To our lovely friends who signed the petition:

Wow, it's been about almost two months since the launch of our public petition on Coworker.org. 
In the interim, many JPMC corporate sites have already started the 5-day return to office, while many more will be starting on April 21st, and several other corporations continue to follow the RTO trend. 
The reasons given are disingeuous and clearly refutable, which goes along with Jamie Dimon's blatant disregard for the nearly 2000 signatures on this petition. However, our efforts have not been in vain.

Through the process of publishing and promoting this petition, we have become more practiced at networking and organizing collective actions. This allows us to transition into the direction of unionization - 
as part of the modern Labor movement, another global trend which has arisen in response to the current state of the economy and job market. If employees of Wells Fargo, Starbucks and Amazon can do it, so can we.

The process of unionization is not a fast or easy one, but it is worthwhile. It cannot happen quickly enough to prevent us from having to choose between working in-office five days a week or working for a different company. 
But it can gradually give us leverage to prevent quality-of-life attacks like this in the future, and to make our workplace better for all employees. And in the meantime, it can give us much-needed hope, community, comradery, and shared resources.
We are currently growing our numbers, mapping our bargaining units, recruiting into un-tapped portions of the JPMC workforce, and overall, growing at the speed of trust. Interested in finding out more, or potentially joining the movement?
