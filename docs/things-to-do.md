## Mapping & Data Entry

A solid organizing campaign begins with **mapping and charting your workplace**. Use a shared spreadsheet or paper to map and gather:
- names, departments, job titles, current “yes/leaning/no” assessment, and best contact method
- Identify informal leaders, union-aligned supervisors if one-on-ones become risky  
- Regularly update & assign rows/sections for volunteers to review or fill

**Example Micro‑Tasks:**
- Pick 3–5 feelings from coworkers who we havent talked to in a bit; ask each person one question: “What’s your #1 concern at work?” and record a one‑sentence summary.
- Update a row with manager response from last meeting.
- Use a Google Form or SMS prompt to crowdsource name‑and‑shift info via peers.

**Best for:** Introverts, detail‑oriented people who prefer structure or individual contribution.
