<h1>
  As of July 10th, JPMC Workers Alliance is officially a Non-Profit Corporation
  in Ohio!
</h1>
<p>
  This grants us certain legal protections and is a major sign that we
  <em>must</em> be taken seriously.
</p>
<p>
  It also allows us to create a bank account and set up a page to collect
  contributions. If your budget allows and you wish to help our efforts
  financially, look for that link in the August newsletter.
</p>
<p>
  To celebrate this milestone and to increase awareness of our efforts, we are
  hosting a summer fun event at the Polaris complex in Columbus, Ohio next week!
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Ice Cream Social!</h2>
<p>Join us at 12:30PM July 30th on the lawn outside McCoy Center B wing!</p>
<p>
  We will be passing out FREE ice cream sandwiches and watermelon to all comers,
  while supplies last.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be splash balls and targets so you can tell us what you need
  most!
</p>
<p>Bring all your colleagues!</p>
<p>
  The poster for this event is
  <a href="https://jpmcworkers.com/img/posters/July_2025_Ice_cream_social.png"
    >here for you to print</a
  >, post, and pass around.
</p>
<p>When hanging posters, please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use areas where other things are already hanging</li>
  <li>
    On surfaces with paint, use easy-lift adhesives, not anything that will
    puncture or remove paint
  </li>
  <li>
    Examples of good locations: cafeterias, break rooms, quiet rooms, seating
    areas, entrances, and hallways
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you follow all of the above and management removes the poster anyway,
  please report this to
  <a href="mailto:jpmcWorkers@gmail.com">jpmcWorkers@gmail.com</a> with a place,
  description of the incident, and contact information for collection into a
  potential Unfair Labor Practices charge.
</p>
<p>We’ll see you there!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>P.S. Did you see the quarterly earnings report?</h4>
<p>Every time I see it, I do some math.</p>
<p>
  For Q2 2025, we made $15 billion in net income. That means AFTER paying all of
  our wages.
</p>
<p>
  Shareholders get 20-25% of that money through dividend payments and whatnot.
  Some of us ARE shareholders, but this does not amount to much money per share.
</p>
<p>
  But WE earned that money, you and I. It is our efforts that keep this company
  running and bringing in revenue.
</p>
<p>Doesn’t it seem fair that we share in some of our earnings, too?</p>
<p>
  Just 25% of Q2 net income is $3.75 billion. If each of us received an equal
  share of that amount, assuming 300,000 employees&hellip;
</p>
<p>That’s $12,500 per employee. For ONE quarter of work.</p>
<p>How much would a 5-figure quarterly bonus improve your life?</p>
<p>THIS is why we need a union.</p>
<p>
  Join us next week to learn more, or hop on
  <a href="https://discord.gg/BZA3pxppq9">our Discord server</a> to get
  involved.

<h4>REMEMBER</h4>
<p>The union is us. We are the union.</p>
<h5>Change is coming. Be a part of it.</h5>

<p>Excitedly Yours,</p>
