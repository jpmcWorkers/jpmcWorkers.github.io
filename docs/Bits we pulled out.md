We got a lot of attention for opposing the RTO mandate with
[this petition]
laying out the case for hybrid work, the reality of the modern office,
what's going on with our culture and leadership,
and the loss of trust that came out of the whole RTO process.

We are clearly a big enough effort to be on the CEO's mind:
[He gave us a salty answer on 12 February 2025 at the town hall in Ohio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1iosoxd/jpmorgan_ceo_i_dont_care_how_many_people_sign/)
But don't let apathy win! Things worth having take time and effort. We're not giving up; we're refocusing. 

**Your signature gets us closer to unity and eventual victory. It also lets coworker.org forward you our newsletter.**

Many of us knowledge-workers have had conversations with fellow employees about the impact of a traditional 5/40 in-office schedule. All but a tiny minority consider it a solution in search of a problem; certainly not a valid solution to any of the problems we actually have. It’s contrary to the public interest, a tax on working, a pointless time-sink, an obstacle to success for every stakeholder but one – all the problems we laid out in the petition – and solves nothing worth solving.

Make no mistake: The same 317,000 bright, innovative JPMC employees who spent the last five years bringing not just record revenues,
[but also record profits,](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-profit-jumps-dealmakers-traders-ride-market-rebound-2025-01-15/)
to the company are perfectly capable of solving whatever problems we set our minds to solving. 

For now, think of the JWA as an open-secret society, free to join* but still in its infancy, with a primary mission to grow up to full size and strength. Fortunately, there are ways to exercise influence while we’re still figuring out bargaining units and gaining the numbers to require union elections. 

Meanwhile, expect the bank to resist, passively at first and later more actively. They may ignore us, ridicule us, deny us, or encourage people to do these things – for one reason: A non-union employer does not wish to lose the dominant negotiating position it holds over the terms of our employment. And make no mistake: the bank is already prepared to fight. (If you happen to be a manager reading this, we can’t collude with you, but we certainly would not complain if, for example, corporate talking points went unsaid or propaganda got misfiled before it made its way to a bulletin board.)

The most important thing in all of this, though, is that 

We hold some key advantages. Chief among them is our ability to begin conversations, one-on-one or in small groups, with other employees on the level and 

We are embarking on this mission one person at a time. Each  But 

We're building a computer-virus for the mind: It reproduces by getting people to propagate the entire virus, and its payload is to add courage and cooperation sufficient to overcome the competing virus that Corporate America has instilled into the general population.

And no, Mr. Dimon. Luxurious new microwave ovens in the break rooms will not fix the problem.

One more thing: You took an [8.3% raise to $39 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-gets-3-million-120701261.html) this past year. We get it: CEOs traditionally receive exorbitant amounts of money. But most of us received pay increases which didn't even keep up with the [2.9% rate of inflation in 2024,](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) , and many got no increase at all! With the firm's record net income of $58.5 billion, you can do better than that.

* Our rights as employees under the National Labor Relations Act and other laws.
* Fair and transparent compensation.
* Relief from the mental-health costs of disingenuous and untrustworthy management culture.


2. Prominent, easily legible posters in common areas of every office detailing
   [workers' rights under the National Labor Relations Act](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-251/employee-rights-under-the-nlra-poster-11-x-17-version-pdf-2022.pdf).

4. Publish aggregated salary and compensation data in for the workforce,
   broken down by job role and seniority without retaliation as stated in the
   [Department of Labor's Pay Transparency Nondiscrimination Provision](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ofccp/pdf/pay-transp_%20English_formattedESQA508c.pdf).

5. Reward results with raises and bonuses proportionate to the firm's yearly profits,
   based on merit and productivity -- not based on the location where that productivity happens.

3. Improve the office environment! Provide enough space and desks. Add cube walls to
   cut the noise. Supply respectable and ergonomic peripherals and monitors. Provide and/or develop sufficient parking.
   Provide more free ammenities, such as meals, fruits, snacks, and more. You can afford it!

7. Last and *most important,* we know that only collective bargaining can
   assure us of any lasting gains. Therefore, *respect our right to organize!*



This is not just about JPMorganChase and its disaffected employees. What happens at the world's largest bank is influential across the industry. Our fight is everyone's fight.

### It Worked for Wells Fargo.

Currently 34 branches and two professional offices are unionized with the Communication Workers of America.

(More details coming soon.)

### Spies will say Lies.

  to discredit and discourage union participation. Read through it to inoculate yourself against the propaganda.
  *If the employer were not desperately worried about what a union might win for the workers, why campaign against them?*

<h1 style="color:red !important">Participation is Protected by Law</h1>

Retaliation is against the law. The National Labor Relations Board
[prosecutes violations vigorously](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/our-enforcement-activity/protected-concerted-activity)
and there's little chance the bank would risk its all-important *reputation* on a violation.

## Why should I sign?

JPMorgan Chase is a global leader.
As such, it must recognize that a truly inclusive workforce extends
beyond the office doors -- right into our homes.

## Remote work is no longer a luxury!

It has become an essential element of work-life balance. It allows us to:

* Stay productive in a quiet, personalized workspace
* Manage household chores
* Care for our families and loved ones
* Get enough rest to stay healthy and focused

For those of us who:

* Care for children, elders, or pets
* Live far from the office
* Have health conditions or disabilities that make commuting difficult
* Get migranes from the fluorescent lights or incessant noise of the office
* Don’t have a private staff to manage daily household tasks
* Live with someone immunocompromised (or are so ourselves)
* Or, have simply built a life around the parameters of remote / hybrid work in light of management's long-repeated claims that it was here to stay

The Return-to-Office (RTO) mandate is no mere inconvenience.
It's an arbitrary, capricious *punishment* for great performance.

Five days *in the office* is outdated.
It's a relic from a time before remote work was possible and effective.
Yet, the Operating Committee is forcing us back to the office full-time:

* Despite record profits being made while employees worked remotely and in hybrid settings
* With an attendance policy that punishes, rather than rewards
* Without compensation for increased costs like childcare, travel, or time spent commuting
* With no flexibility
* And without even guaranteeing you a desk to work at once you’re there!

## We are professionals, and we should be treated like it.

If you're tired of:

* Adding hours of commuting to your workday just to take Zoom calls in person
* Sacrificing time with your loved ones for a billionaire’s vision of "culture"
* Facing the threat of discipline or termination because of where you work
* Fouling your work-life balance


## You are not alone.
