# Booklets

These should be PDFs that you can send directly to a printing service, or they should work on any printer.

The following booklets make specific reference to US labor law, and are sized to fit US Letter (8.5 x 11 inch) paper.

*We would love if someone would create booklets suitable for other countries.*

The color version *will work* if printed in B&W.
