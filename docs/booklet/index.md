# Booklets

These should be PDFs that you can send directly to a printing service, or they should work on any printer.

* [Here's a video on how to fold them.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FzsRiA-pQ1MA2J8yq9QZb-EI1QUqpxTN/view?usp=drive_link)

The following booklets make specific reference to US labor law, and are sized to fit US Letter (8.5 x 11 inch) paper.

*We would love if someone would create booklets suitable for other countries.*

**Tips on authoring booklets of your own are at the bottom of this page.**

A version optimized for black-and-white is forthcoming.

# Authoring Booklets

Keep it terse. You have no room!

Remember visual hierarchy: Use different font sizes and styles to distinguish headers and bullet points from body text.

Reggie recommends around 750 words.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
and
[Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
have both worked, but in theory any drawing or desktop-publishing application should work.
One of us means to experiment with [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/).
Paid choices include Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw.

The discord may or may not offer templates for one or more of these formats.

The basic layout is:

<table border="1">
<tr><td>Page 6</td><td>Page 5</td><td>Page 4</td><td>Page 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Back Cover</td><td>Front Cover</td><td>Page 1</td><td>Page 2</td></tr>
</table

Note that the top row is upside down.
