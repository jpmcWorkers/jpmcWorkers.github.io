# Booklets

These should be PDFs that you can send directly to a printing service, or they should work on any printer.

These are sized to fit US 8.5 x 11 inch paper. 

## US Letter (8.5 x 11 inch) -- North America

### The SPIT Booklet

## A4-sized (210 x 297 mm) -- Everywhere else

A4 paper is a bit taller and narrower than US Letter.
If you can scale the print, then it should work.
Otherwise, we need artists who work in those sizes.
