We'll keep this updated typically on weekends. Check back each Monday for the latest.

## Rights you should know you have:

* [USA: Protected Concerted Activities](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-184/nlrb-flyer-627.pdf)
* [UK: Your rights at work](https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/rights-trade-unions)

## We are everywhere.

We have members in New York, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, California, and Washington, as well as several cities in the United Kingdom.

To get connected, the best way to start is to build a network of trustworthy colleagues.
Open up about what's really going on *at a safe time and place where you won't be overheard.*
Ask others about how RTO impacts them. Relate.
Get colleagues sharing our social and video feeds. 
And then keep building your network.
Sooner or later, these networks will begin to merge into larger groups,
especially if you have lunch with someone new each day.

## Why to Still Sign the RTO Opposition Petition:

If you signed [the petition](https://www.coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers) as an employee, thank you for your courage and leadership.
Signatures have slowed down considerably as of the end of February.
We are hoping for a bump during the first week of March as people begin to feel the effects of 5-day RTO.

At this point, the CEO has made it abundantly clear that he will not heed a petition.
The value of delivering it is therefore doubtful.
However, signing [the petition](https://www.coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers) still gets you on a mailing list.
*We do NOT see your e-mail address. That stays with coworker.org.*
This is one way for the core group to try to reach out.
Expect mails -- they'll probably be marked "promotions" -- from us "via coworker.org".

### You will not be disciplined for signing the petition.

* Retaliation is infeasible: All names will be kept secret until there are far too many to discriminate against.
* [Retaliation is also against the law](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-251/employee-rights-under-the-nlra-poster-11-x-17-version-pdf-2022.pdf).
