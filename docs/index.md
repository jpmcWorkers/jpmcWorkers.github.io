We'll keep this updated typically on weekends. Check back each Monday for the latest.

## Rights you should know you have:

* [USA: Protected Concerted Activities](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-184/nlrb-flyer-627.pdf)
* [UK: Your rights at work](https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/rights-trade-unions)

## We are everywhere.

We have members in New York, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, California, and Washington, as well as several cities in the United Kingdom.

To get connected, the best way to start is to build a network of trustworthy colleagues.
Open up about what's really going on *at a safe time and place where you won't be overheard.*
Ask others about how RTO impacts them. Relate.
Get colleagues sharing our social and video feeds. 
And then keep building your network.
Sooner or later, these networks will begin to merge into larger groups,
especially if you have lunch with someone new each day.

## Current Status of the RTO Petition:

**Update on Our Workplace Flexibility Initiative**

Thank you for your overwhelming support and engagement with our workplace flexibility petition. With nearly 2,000 signatures, you've made it clear that this issue matters deeply to our community at Chase. As we navigate this first week of the full return-to-office mandate, we wanted to provide an important update on our approach.

**Protecting Our Supporters:**

After careful consideration of feedback from signers, non-signers, and our understanding of leadership's position, we have decided not to formally submit the individual names attached to the petition. This decision was made to protect everyone who supported our cause from potential individual targeting. We will instead reference the total number of supporters when communicating with leadership, demonstrating the significant opposition to the mandate while safeguarding individual privacy.

**Supporting Concerned Colleagues:**

We've heard that some colleagues are experiencing anxiety about potential retaliation. If you know someone who has expressed fear about signing the petition, please reach out to reassure them that their name and email will remain confidential. Our primary concern is creating a safe environment for all employees to express their workplace needs without fear.

**Moving Forward Together:**

We are actively planning the next steps to address the RTO mandate. We are researching effective ways to organize our voices to continue advocating for workplace flexibility that benefits both employees and Chase. We remain committed to finding constructive solutions that acknowledge the diverse needs of our workforce while maintaining our professional standards.
We will be sharing more detailed plans in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we encourage anyone interested in contributing to reach out to us.

## Why to Still Sign the RTO Opposition Petition:

If you signed [the petition](https://www.coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers) as an employee, thank you for your courage and leadership.
Signatures have slowed down considerably as of the end of February.
We are hoping for a bump during the first week of March as people begin to feel the effects of 5-day RTO.

At this point, the CEO has made it abundantly clear that he will not heed a petition.
The value of delivering it is therefore doubtful.
However, signing [the petition](https://www.coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers) still gets you on a mailing list.
*We do NOT see your e-mail address. That stays with coworker.org.*
This is one way for the core group to try to reach out.
Expect mails -- they'll probably be marked "promotions" -- from us "via coworker.org".

### You will not be disciplined for signing the petition.

* Retaliation is infeasible: All names will be kept secret until there are far too many to discriminate against.
* [Retaliation is also against the law](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-251/employee-rights-under-the-nlra-poster-11-x-17-version-pdf-2022.pdf).
