## Rights you should know you have:

* [USA: Protected Concerted Activities](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-184/nlrb-flyer-627.pdf)
* [UK: Your rights at work](https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/rights-trade-unions)

Generally, and despite what you may have been told,
**you *are allowed* to talk with other employees** about your

* Pay,
* Benefits,
* Working Conditions,
* Hours,
* Job security -- or lack thereof,
* Unions -- forming them, joining them,
  [how they work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd5x7vRZlT4),
  [what they do](https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do),
  [how and why companies try to prevent them](https://unionBustingPlayBook.com),
* or any other related topic

at all times and places where you can talk about other non-work subjects such as sports or current events.
Classically this includes breaks and lunch, but also parking lots or other gatherings.

**For Your Safety:**

Consider that any device, network, or space that the employer owns or controls may be spying for the employer.
The best place to speak freely is someplace the company does not control.

## RTO Petition Status

If you have already signed [the petition](/openletter) as an employee,
thank you for your courage and solidarity.

At this point, that particular operation has largely run its course.
We got a good bit of media attention at the time and raised much awareness for our cause.

Our CEO's profanity-laced words became famous on 12 February when he declared,
"I don't care how many people sign that f___ing petition".
That shows he knows about it; that he is paying attention to *our* impact on the media;
and that he knows that a good many of us had the courage to sign.

It also shows that we're going to need a bigger movement.
That's why we're now recommending steps that will build
community, leadership, and solidarity among the rank-and-file
in a way that help us all achieve better conditions -- together.

**United, We Stand!**
