## Rights you should know you have:

* [USA: Protected Concerted Activities](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-184/nlrb-flyer-627.pdf)
* [USA: Employee Rights under the NLRA](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-251/employee-rights-under-the-nlra-poster-11-x-17-version-pdf-2022.pdf)
* [UK: Your Rights at Work](https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/rights-trade-unions)

Generally, and despite what you may have been told,
**you *are allowed* to talk with other employees** about your

* Pay,
* Benefits,
* Working Conditions,
* Hours,
* Job security -- or lack thereof,
* Unions -- forming them, joining them,
  [how they work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd5x7vRZlT4),
  [what they do](https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do),
  [how and why companies try to prevent them](https://unionBustingPlayBook.com),
* or any other related topic

at all times and places where you can talk about other non-work subjects such as sports or current events.
Classically this includes breaks and lunch, but also parking lots or other gatherings.

**For Your Safety:**

Consider that any device, network, or space that the employer owns or controls may be spying for the employer.
The best place to speak freely is someplace the company does not control.

## Current Operation:

In the process of researching and fighting to retain our WFH, we have pursued multiple avenues to see what it takes to accomplish this simple goal. We have discovered that even the most obvious and dire accommodation request cases for WFH/FWA/hybrid schedules are being denied, delayed, and deflected. Additionally, *other* reasonable accommodations requests are falling victim to the same treatment. This pattern of systemic discrimination against the very real (but reasonable) needs being expressed by JPMC employees is, as you can imagine, both very illegal and unethical. Pursuing this route of regaining WFH for those who need it as an accommodation could pave the way to regaining it for the rest of us (and more) in the future.

The Employer has made it unreasonably difficult for people with long-term medical conditions or
disabilities to obtain the reasonable accommodations their private doctors prescribe
in accordance with either the *Americans with Disabilities Act (US)* or *Equality Act of 2010 (UK)*.
There is a limited list of valid reasons not to provide a requested accommodation,
and *"everyone else will want one too"* **is not on that list!**

If you or someone you know has been affected by this -- especially if the issue is
brought on or made worse by recent policy changes (such as RTO or hot-desking) --
then we are looking to [get in contact.](/contact)

**Time is of the essence!** We have some options to fight this problem in an organized,
coordinated manner which stands an excellent chance to move further and faster than
any one of us could do on our own. However, there are statutory time-limits.

Overview of how this is *supposed* to work (USA perspective):

1. You have a disability.
2. Your employer has 15 or more employees.
3. You have a written request for accommodation from the qualified healthcare provider of your choice.
4. The requested accommodation does not "place an undue burden on the employer." *(It does not! We've all been WFHing for years!)*
5. Employer must provide the requested accommodation in accordance with the law!
