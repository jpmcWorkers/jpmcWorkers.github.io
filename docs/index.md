**Welcome to the home page of the JPMC Workers Alliance.**

Our current activity is to fight the RTO mandate with coordinated collective action.

<h1 style="color:red !important">Participation is Safe and Effective</h1>

Retaliation is against the law. The National Labor Relations Board
[prosecutes violations vigorously](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/our-enforcement-activity/protected-concerted-activity)
and there's little chance the bank would risk its all-important *reputation* on a violation.

# JPMC Workers, Unite!
**You have nothing to lose but RTO.**

## YOU CAN'T COERCE CULTURE.

JPMorgan Chase is a global leader. As such, it must recognize that a truly inclusive workforce extends beyond the office doors -- right into our homes.

## Remote work is no longer a luxury!

It has become an essential element of work-life balance. It allows us to:

* Stay productive in a quiet, personalized workspace
* Manage household chores
* Care for our families and loved ones
* Get enough rest to stay healthy and focused

For those of us who:

* Care for children, elders, or pets
* Live far from the office
* Have disabilities that make commuting difficult
* Don’t have a private staff to manage daily household tasks

The Return to Office (RTO) mandate is no mere inconvenience. It's a setback.

Five days a week in the office is outdated. It's a relic from a time before remote work was possible and effective. Yet, the Operating Committee is forcing us back to the office full-time:

* Despite record profits being made while employees worked remotely and in hybrid settings
* With an attendance policy that punishes, rather than rewards
* Without compensation for increased costs like childcare, travel, or time spent commuting
* And without even guaranteeing you a desk to work at once you’re there!

## We are professionals, and we should be treated like it.

If you're tired of:

* Adding hours of commuting to your workday just to take Zoom calls in person
* Sacrificing time with your loved ones for a billionaire’s vision of "culture"
* Facing the threat of discipline or termination because of where you work
* Losing your work-life balance


## You are not alone.

**Sign the petition, stand with us, and make your voice heard.**

**Together, we can make a difference.**
