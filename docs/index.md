**Welcome to the home page of the JPMC Workers Alliance.**

Our current activity is to fight the RTO mandate with coordinated collective action.

# JPMC Workers, Unite! You have nothing to lose but RTO!

## YOU CAN'T COERCE CULTURE.

JPMorgan Chase is a global company, and that should include your home office.

**Remote work is no longer a luxury!** It's a cornerstone of work-life balance that lets us:

1. Stay productive in a quiet space
2. Cook and clean our homes
3. Care for our loved ones
4. Get enough sleep!

every single day.
If you work at JPMC and:

* have people or pets to care for
* live an long way from your office
* have any sort of disability yourself
* don't have staff to cook and clean for you daily

You are negatively affected by RTO.

Five days a week in-office is an outdated policy -- a fossil from a time when it was impossible to work from home.

Yet the Operating Committee is forcing us back into the office five days a week,

* despite the firm posting record profits under remote and hybrid work
* under an attendance policy that only punishes and never rewards
* without compensation for increased childcare, time, and travel costs
* without even guaranteeing you have a desk to work on!

## We are professionals, and we should be treated like it.

If you don't want to add HOURS OF TRAFFIC to your work-day just to take Zoom calls in-office...

If you don't want to sacrifice your time with loved ones for a billionaire's idea of 'culture'...

If you think it's wrong to be disciplined or terminated because of *where* you create shareholder value...

If your work-life balance is better with remote work...

You are not alone. Sign your name. Let your voice be heard.
