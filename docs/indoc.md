# JPMC Workers Alliance -- Quick Indoc

**Utterly Confused?** [Start here](https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do).

**Current Leadership Structure:** Rag-Tag Band of Misfits.

**Convenient Links:**

* JWA Web Site: jpmcWorkers.com
* The Petition: [coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers](https://coworker.org/p/jpmcWorkers) -- sign it to get on our mailing list. So JD ignores it: We can get louder.

Representatives from both CWA and UE are present in the Organizing chat.

* UE = United Electrical
* CWA = Communication Workers of America, the same people that Wells Fargo affiliated with.

Eventually we formally affiliate with one of them.

## Current Rules:

* Don't do anything illegal.
* Act with Respect.
* Balance consensus with initiative.

## Tips:

* You MAY wish to change your signal name to appear anonymous.
* There MAY be spies.
	* It's unlawful if there are, but laws have been broken before.
	* See also: Settings >> Privacy >> Phone Number
	* Stick around the chats and you'll soon get a sense of who's who.
* The chats do get chatty, so manage your phone notifications.

## Background:

RTO '25 inspired this group.

We are not here to throw rocks. We are building an army capable of standing up to the world's largest financial empire -- and winning.
Rome wasn't built in a day, and we will certainly all face RTO. But let us recall the morning of 7 December 1941:
The Empire of Japan dealt a terrible blow to the United States' smaller Pacific fleet, putting 19 ships and many airfields out of action.
Less than four years later, the United States Navy accepted Japan's unconditional surrender aboard the USS Missouri.

RTO will be like our Pearl Harbor. It will hurt, but it will also:

* Shock us out of complacency
* Attract sympathizers
* Help us convince the undecided and the misinformed.

For now, we need to build a robust whisper-network and find a way to understand the scope of our reach.
We also need some volunteers to take on specific collateral duties related to organizing and indoctrination.
