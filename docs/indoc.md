Blue = "J"PMC. Jamie Dimon isn't Chase. We are.

Red = Labor, AKA the "W"orkers. The red triangles point clockwise. The labor is what keeps Chase moving. Why Red? Roses are a traditional symbol of Labor movement in this country. 

Yellow/Wheat = "A"lliance.  Like roses, bread/wheat is traditional symbol of Labor movement in this country. The triangles point inward symbolizing the act of coming together to work as team.
