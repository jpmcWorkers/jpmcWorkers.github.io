# JWA Carpool Program
### Brought to you by the JPMC Workers Alliance

### _Making commuting cheaper, greener, and less stressful – together_


**Q:** Why is the Workers Alliance promoting carpooling?  
**A:** Parking is a headache, gas prices are high, and traffic is getting worse. Carpooling is a grassroots way for us as coworkers to take back some control over our commutes, reduce costs, and make things a little more sane — without waiting on corporate to fix it.

**Q:** What are the benefits for me personally?  
 * Save money on gas and maintenance.
 * Share the drive (or skip it entirely some days).
 * Reduce stress and avoid parking battles.
 * Meet coworkers you might not otherwise connect with.
 * Help the planet — fewer cars means lower emissions.

**Q:** How does carpooling help with parking?  
**A:** The more we share rides, the fewer cars need to fight for space. Even a 10% reduction in cars on-site can make a big difference in availability and stress levels.
 
**Q:** What if my schedule is unusual?  
**A:** That’s totally fine. Many folks are doing hybrid work or flex hours. We’re encouraging people to match up with others on similar schedules — even if it's just 1–2 days a week. Something is better than nothing.

**Q:** What if I need to leave early or have an emergency?  
**A:** Carpooling is built on solidarity and looking out for each other, not just convenience. We don’t have funds to cover last-minute rides like Ubers however you might from saving gas money. We will however, do everything we can as a group to help each other out. That might mean finding another driver, a nearby coworker. You will never be left behind with us.

**Q:** Is this approved by JPMC?  
**A:** This is an employee-led effort. We're not affiliated with management. There’s nothing stopping coworkers from organizing smarter commutes together — and if it builds enough momentum, it might just inspire some institutional support.

**Q:** Is it safe?  
**A:** You only ride with people you’re comfortable with. Many people start with teammates or known coworkers. We also encourage clear expectations and communication (no surprise 45-minute detours for coffee).

**Q:** What if I don’t want to carpool but still want to help?  
**A:** Totally cool. Spread the word, help organize, or just encourage teammates to give it a try. Small changes lead to big improvements when done together.

**Q:** Where can I sign up or learn more?  
**A:** We’re working on a system in [Discord](https://discord.gg/BZA3pxppq9) where you can find matches, share ride offers, or get involved. Drop your info and let’s get rolling.
