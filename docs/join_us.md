# JPMC Workers Alliance - Join the Movement!

## Can I join?

Meanwhile, you can help prepare the way:

* Get to know your colleagues as people, not mere cogs in a machine. Learn what they enjoy doing, what makes them happy, etc.
* Include members of your own team, others you collaborate with, and those you regularly bump into.

By the same token, **do not fraternize with the management.**
Their interest aligns with the status quo, regardless of what they may say.
Leave them out of the social circles we're building.
They should not insist on joining. If you get trouble in this regard,
