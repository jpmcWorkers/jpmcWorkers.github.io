# Open Letter to Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon

We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace:
its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the toxicity that metastasized in our company
culture in the last couple of months. As devoted employees, we must advocate for what is
best: not merely for ourselves, but also for the customer, the shareholder, and the nation.

Six years ago, full-time in-office was the norm. Covid-19 lock-downs forced change upon
the world. It was uncomfortable, but we adapted. So must you. Corporate America does not
"pretend" to work-from-home (WFH): It achieves record profits and productivity, cuts costs,
and improves morale, retention, and carbon footprint. Furthermore, new employees came up to
speed just fine for the last five years.

WFH may not be for in-person services, but for almost everyone else, it's the way of the
future. Management repeated for years that it was *the best way to run the bank* and here
to stay. Indeed, it's often the only way to get any work done! The office environment is
now overcrowded and getting worse, noisy, and hard to concentrate in. Our teams are smeared
across the globe (increasingly in low-wage countries) so that half the people are on zoom
calls at any time, or waking up early to talk to India and Asia. The workstations are sub-par.
Finally, the creature comforts are often sorely lacking -- unless you happen to be one of
the anointed few in the disconcertingly-magical new building on Park Avenue.

Your recent 100% return-to-office (RTO) mandate is transparently an attempt to turn back the
clock to the bad-old-days: Bad for business, bad for the customer, bad for the shareholder.
It's also terrible corporate citizenship. Finally, its genesys emphasizes a lack of trust
between mercurial management and worried labor force that undermines leadership and risks
toppling the financial empire that is JPMorganChase.

And no, Mr. Dimon. Luxurious new microwave ovens in the break rooms will not fix the problem.

It is our sacred duty to reject RTO, but also to suppport:

* Our rights as employees under the National Labor Relations Act and other laws.
* Stable, predictable, comfortable, and efficient working conditions.
* Fair and transparent compensation.
* A culture that promotes mutual respect across all levels.
* Workers' quality of life, and thereby their health and productivity.
* The schedule autonomy which should already be granted to all professional workers.
* Reduced pollution, cost-burden, and time of commuting to and from the office.
* Relief from the mental-health costs of disingenuous and untrustworthy management culture.

We the undersigned hereby demand of JPMC:

1. Retain (or return to) the flexible hybrid-working model for those job categories that
   have already worked under it -- regardless of rank -- and direct investment to enable
   more categories of workers to experience the same.

2. Prominent, easily legible posters in common areas of every office detailing
   [workers' rights under the National Labor Relations Act](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-251/employee-rights-under-the-nlra-poster-11-x-17-version-pdf-2022.pdf).

3. Improve the office environment! Provide enough space and desks; add cube walls to
   cut the noise; supply respectable keyboards and mice and screens; provide parking.
   While you're at it, maybe throw in some fruits or snacks. You can afford it!

4. Publish salary and compensation data in aggregate for its workforce,
   broken down by job role and seniority without retaliation as stated in the
   [Department of Labor's Pay Transparency Nondiscrimination Provision](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ofccp/pdf/pay-transp_%20English_formattedESQA508c.pdf).

5. Reward results, with raises and bonuses proportionate to the firm's yearly profits,
   based on merit and productivity. Refrain from penalizing workers based on *where*
   they happen to acheive that productivity.

6. Enable remote-capable workers to work from any JPMC corporate office in the region.

# Why is this important? 

The firm's most valuable asset is its sterling reputation.
To keep that reputation out of harm's way, the customers and the shareholders
need for it not to
[run off its best and brightest](https://www.hrdive.com/news/rto-mandates-lead-to-brain-drain-attrition/734989/)
(or most vulnerable) employees.
[They'll be extra hard to replace.](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/rto-mandates-lead-to-higher-turnover--recruiting-challenges)
RTO policies can and will continue to threaten the morale of employees,
[resulting in loss of skilled employees](https://fortune.com/2024/12/13/return-to-office-mandate-risk-losing-top-performers-study/)
who consistently meet key performance indicators (KPIs).
Indeed our own CFO, Jeremy Barron,
[declared publicly that attrition is bad for business and leads to negative effects.](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/chase-wells-fargo-bank-america-citi-earnings/card/jpmorgan-cfo-says-firm-isn-t-hoping-office-push-prompts-attrition-UcpzAPU4dZikOvwkZ6sk)

will go unmitigated by a departed expert before something goes
[Knight-Capital-style?](https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html)
Given the bank's pivotal role in the global financial system, more than just employees should be concerned.

RTO is also an unethical strategy of
[under-the-table discrimination carrying significant legal risks.](https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/the-rising-legal-risks-of-rto-policies/)
The boss-man may not care, but many customers will.

Our company’s [Business Principles](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/how-we-do-business.pdf),
which the CEO personally signed, make it our duty as employees to “Provide constant feedback -- tell people when they are doing a good job and, more important, when they are not”. Mr. Dimon, we believe you are making a terrible mistake. Given that “leadership is an honor and a responsibility”, we hope that you are able to recognize that this RTO policy does not “Help our people take care of themselves”, nor does it promote open dialogue.

Despite a [sixth consecutive year of record revenue and growth](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/annual-report/2023/ar-ceo-letters),
our purpose as a company to
[“Make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, everyday”](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/how-we-do-business.pdf)
is unattainable when employees are repeatedly deceived, disregarded, and silenced:
First hybrid was the way, the truth, the light.
Then the [Managing Directors told you how little they thought of RTO in April of '23](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-employees-gripe-about-dimons-return-to-office-edict-2023-04-27/),
but that got shut down quick.
More recently, the internal comments on the global RTO edict of 10 January were shut down before lunch.

Studies consistently show that
[remote work delivers proven results on productivity,](https://bospar.com/press-release/bospars-10th-anniversary-research-confirms-remote-work-drives-superior-business-outcomes/)
including [reducing turnover and increasing profits](https://hbr.org/2024/10/one-company-a-b-tested-hybrid-work-heres-what-they-found)
as retaining seniority is important. During the years since COVID lock-downs began, JPMC employees' work has continuously produced record profits for the bank – all while working from home and from the office in a hybrid and manner.

But the Darling of Wall Street and CEO of the world's biggest bank thinks otherwise.
