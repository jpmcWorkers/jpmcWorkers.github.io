# Am I a manager?

Things that make you a manager:

* Authority to hire, fire, evaluate, discipline, or reassign employees (or contractors)
* Employees (or contractors) who reasonably believe that you have such authority

Things that do not make you a manager:

* Participating in hiring interviews
* Working in HR
* Being a Senior Associate or VP

On the US side, there is a [technical definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=29-USC-1697229976-858777245&term_occur=999&term_src=title:29:chapter:7:subchapter:II:section:152)
in the National Labor Relations Act.

*Example:* Alice and Bob are in Houston on the same team.
Alice is a VP, and Bob is an Associate.
The rest of the team is in other cities.
Alice works for Carol, an ED in London.
Carol has told Bob that he "reports to Alice",
but Carol hired Bob and does the annual evaluations for both.
Meanwhile, Alice cannot access manager tools in go/me.

In this case, Alice and Bob should confer together with Carol to determine exactly what authority Alice really has.
If it's simply about having a local contact to call in sick, then Alice is not a manager.
On the other hand, if Carol plans to rubber-stamp Alice's discretion to hire/fire/discipline,
then Alice does act as a de-facto manager. In either case, it's important for Bob to be part of
the same conversation.
