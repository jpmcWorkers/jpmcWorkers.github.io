# RTO Petition Status

If you have already signed [the petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/professional-dignity) as an employee,
thank you for your courage and solidarity.

At this point, that particular operation has largely run its course.
We got a good bit of media attention at the time and raised much awareness for our cause.

Our CEO's profanity-laced words became famous on 12 February when he declared,
"I don't care how many people sign that f___ing petition".
That shows he knows about it; that he is paying attention to *our* impact on the media;
and that he knows that a good many of us (nearly 2,000) had the courage to sign *despite* our fears.

It also shows that we're going to need a bigger movement.
That's why we're now recommending steps that will build
community, leadership, and solidarity among the rank-and-file
in a way that help us all achieve better conditions -- together.
