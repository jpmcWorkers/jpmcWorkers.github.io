# JWA: Issues 

The RTO mandate of early 2025 brought us together, but here's an abstraction of what our members have brought up.

## Top Issues -- Per Survey Metric (so far):

* **RTO is bad for workers:** commute, noise, expense, caregiver needs, disability, neurodivergence, etc.
* **Pay is not keeping up:** with cost of living, to say nothing of record profits. The math isn't mathing.

**Note:** It's not our job to make a business case for our demands: *Of course* they'd cost money. *That's why the company tries to fight them.* But without workers, there *is* no business. We deserve a fair say in these matters.

## Universal Issues:

* Working Conditions:
	* Clean, Safe, Healthy Working Environment
	* Well-defined procedures that actually work
	* Regular, relevant, and effective training
	* Fair treatment from management
	* Reasonable accommodations for employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or local equivalent
	* For remote-parking, will shuttles be available throughout the day for e.g. late arrivals / emergency departures?

* Pay / Compensation and Advancement:
	* Fairness: Are fresh graduates making more than old hands? Are men making more than women for the same work? Am I paid much less than my peers?
	* Transparency: How can we tell the answers to the questions above?
	* Participation: The company keeps posting record annual **profits** over and over and over again. We did that. Record profits demand record pay!
	* Get rid of that filthy arbitration clause in the employment contracts!
	* When someone has the requisite skills and the experience, advancement should follow.
	* Skills-training needs to become a regular part of our job; not merely an optional extra.

* Benefits
	* Parking: Downtown, parking is an expensive challenge. At campuses, parking is not secure and often remote.
	* Child care: Your kid grows old on the Bright Horizons wait-list. Also, it's comparatively expensive.
	* Meals, whether downtown or in campuses, are unreasonably expensive (or time-consuming, if prepared at home).

* Hours / Schedule
	* Some companies have had success with a 4-day work-week. Why not us? (Meetings expand to fill time?)
	* We've proven that hybrid/remote works great, regardless of what noise comes out of the CEO's mouth. Bring it back!
	* The company wants to increase efficiency via modern technology. That should translate into less hours worked.

* Job Security
	* People should not be fired or disciplined for arbitrary or capricious reasons.
	* Performance Reviews need to be accurate and unbiased.

* Environmental Stewardship
	* We talk a good game about the environment, so shouldn't we get out of the fossil-fuels business?
	* Public Transit Benefit would get cars off the road -- and help with parking.
	* EV chargers in corporate parking lots would encourage EV adoption.
	* Sustainability is Work-from-Home. (Hybrid model seems to be the sweet-spot for most.)

* Corporate Governance
	* Worker representation on the board

## Focus by Job Category:

Different job categories will have different motivations to join together and militate for change.
For example, software developers might be paid well *compared to other professions,*
but face long hours, high stress, unrealistic deadlines, and poor guidance.
Meanwhile, lock-box employees might have consistent hours but low pay and a dirty environment.

Differences here may ultimately delineate bargaining units -- but that's a future problem.
Right now we're looking to build community around commonality.
