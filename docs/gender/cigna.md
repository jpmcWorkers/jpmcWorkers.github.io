## How to Electrolysis:

This step-by-step *(sort of)* guide should help you get electrolysis (mostly) covered by Cigna.
It should end up costing you something like $15 per session, which is insanely cheap as electrolysis goes.

The general plan is:

1. Get and submit a *behavioral health* letter of medical necessity for clearance. You may be able to get this from the EAP counselors. The letter must include:
	* Diagnosis code `F.64.0 gender dysphoria`
	* Procedure code `cpt 17380` for electrolysis
	* Say specifically the targeted area of treatment (the face/neck ) (or groin area- has to have authorization for Gender reassignment surgery approved prior to this electrolysis) 
2. Get *Included Health* to
	* perform a search for electrolysis providers in your area,
	* find nobody in-network with reasonable driving distance,
	* and recommend a non-network provider.
3. Get a *primary doctor or surgeon* as the ordering md to:
	* Submit clinical information/ Letter of medical necessity that supports the surgery or procedure that is being requested that includes:
		* All the same information as the behavioral health letter
		* Their tax id, fax number, address, etc.
	* Fill out and sign the [Medical-Network Adequacy Provision Exception Form](https://static.cigna.com/assets/chcp/pdf/resourceLibrary/medical/medical-network-exception-request-form.pdf) with:
		* Location of services
		* Electrolysis location
		* Their tax id, fax number, address, etc.
		* The reason for requesting electrolysis network adequacy is there are no in network providers per Included Health.
4. Pester Cigna until they give you pre-approval. **Do not proceed without approval, or reimbursement will be denied.**
5. Find out from Cigna your coverage budget per-session. Arrange your sessions to spend about this much per session. (You may need more sessions.)
6. Get the electrolysis clinic to provide receipts with:
	* Letter head with name of location, address, phone and fax number
	* Amount billed
	* Diagnosis code `F.64.0 gender dysphoria`
	* Procedure code `cpt 17380` for electrolysis
	* A written or diagram of area on each treatment session
7. Pay up front out of pocket and get the full receipts.
8. E-mail the receipts to Jacki.Trammell@CignaHealthcare.com who will work with you on the claim for reimbursement.
9. Pray. (It should be fine.)
