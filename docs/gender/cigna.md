## How to Electrolysis:

This step-by-step *(sort of)* guide should help you get electrolysis (mostly) covered by Cigna.
It should end up costing you something like $15 per session, which is insanely cheap as electrolysis goes.

The general plan is:

1. Get and submit a *behavioral health* letter of medical necessity for clearance. You may be able to get this from the EAP counselors. The letter must include:
	* Diagnosis code `F.64.0 gender dysphoria`
	* Procedure code `cpt 17380` for electrolysis
	* Say specifically the targeted area of treatment (the face/neck ) (or groin area- has to have authorization for Gender reassignment surgery approved prior to this electrolysis) 
2. Get *Included Health* to
	* perform a search for electrolysis providers in your area,
	* find nobody in-network with reasonable driving distance,
	* and recommend a non-network provider.
3. Get a *primary doctor or surgeon* as the ordering md to:
	* Prepare clinical information / Letter of medical necessity that supports the surgery or procedure that is being requested that includes:
		* All the same information as the behavioral health letter
		* Their tax id, fax number, address, etc.
	* Fill out and sign the [Medical-Network Adequacy Provision Exception Form](https://static.cigna.com/assets/chcp/pdf/resourceLibrary/medical/medical-network-exception-request-form.pdf) with:
		* Location of services
		* Electrolysis location
		* Their tax id, fax number, address, etc.
		* The reason for requesting electrolysis network adequacy is there are no in network providers per Included Health.
        * See notes below on how to fill out this form
    * The entire package - behavioral health, medical necessity, and network adequacy --
      gets faxed *together* to 833-213-9222 (the number on the NAP Medical form's first page).
4. Wait 10 business days, then pester Cigna (Transgender care team) until they give you pre-approval. **Do not proceed without approval, or reimbursement will be denied.**
5. Find out from Cigna your coverage budget per-session.
    * Call `800-790-3086`.
    * Ask to speak with an *LGBT One Guide Representative*.
    * Get them to quote you the *Maximum Reimbursable Rate* for **Electrolysis CPT 17380**.
    * Arrange your sessions to spend about this much per session. (You may need more sessions.)
6. Get the electrolysis clinic to provide receipts with:
	* Letter head with name of location, address, phone and fax number
	* Amount billed
	* Diagnosis code `F.64.0 gender dysphoria`
	* Procedure code `CPT 17380` for electrolysis
	* A written or diagram of area on each treatment session
7. Pay up front out of pocket and get the full receipts.
8. E-mail the receipts to Jacki.Trammell@CignaHealthcare.com who will work with you on the claim for reimbursement.
9. Pray. (It should be fine.)

## Filling out the Medical-Network Adequacy Provision (NAP) Exception Request Form

### Page One

This is all personal information for you, the patient.

### Page Two

* Provider Information:
    * This is the doctor who is "prescribing" electrolysis.
    * The "Office Information" section refers again to physician services, not electrolysis services.
    * You are probably *not* requesting Network Adequacy for this *provider.*

* Facility Information:
    * This is the place that's going to do your electrolysis.
    * If the electrologist won't provide a tax ID number (or has no fax), explain their reasoning in the "Additional Infomation" section on page 3.
    * You are indeed requesting Network Adequacy for this *facility.*

* Service Infomation:
    * `Electrolysis for face and neck -- There are no in-network providers of, nor facilities for, this service within the patient's service area, per search via both Included Health and Cigna's own transgender care coordination team.`

### Page Three

### Then what?

Send it to your doctor in as pre-filled a state as possible so they have an easy time with it.
Remind your doctor to include both letters and the form in a package and to fax to
the **NAP Medical** number on the first page of the form. (Currently that's 833-213-9222.)

If you still have questions, call Cigna (number on the back of your card, or 800-790-3086)
and ask for the transgender care team. (You may need to ask for "operator" to get past the robot.)
