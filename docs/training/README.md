# Training Documentation

Welcome to the JPMC Workers Alliance website training documentation! This documentation follows the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which organizes documentation into four distinct types, each serving a specific purpose.

## About Diátaxis

Diátaxis is a systematic approach to documentation that recognizes that users have different needs at different times. The framework divides documentation into four types:

1. **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented, step-by-step lessons
2. **How-to Guides** - Goal-oriented, practical problem-solving
3. **Reference** - Information-oriented, technical specifications
4. **Explanation** - Understanding-oriented, background and context

Each type answers a different question:
- **Tutorials**: "How do I learn to do this?"
- **How-to Guides**: "How do I accomplish this specific task?"
- **Reference**: "What are the technical details?"
- **Explanation**: "Why is it this way?"

## Documentation Structure

This training documentation is organized for two main audiences:

### For Developers
If you're contributing code to the website, start with the developer documentation:

- **[Tutorials](tutorials/developers/)** - Learn the fundamentals step-by-step
- **[How-to Guides](how-to-guides/developers/)** - Solve specific development tasks
- **[Reference](reference/developers/)** - Look up technical details
- **[Explanations](explanations/developers/)** - Understand the architecture and decisions

### For Content Editors
If you're adding or editing content (newsletters, resources, pages), start with the content editor documentation:

- **[Tutorials](tutorials/content-editors/)** - Learn to add content step-by-step
- **[How-to Guides](how-to-guides/content-editors/)** - Complete specific content tasks
- **[Reference](reference/content-editors/)** - Look up content formats and requirements
- **[Explanations](explanations/content-editors/)** - Understand content organization and workflow

## Quick Start

### New Developers
1. Start with [Getting Started](tutorials/developers/01-getting-started.md)
2. Follow the tutorials in order (01-06)
3. Refer to how-to guides as you work on specific tasks
4. Use reference docs when you need technical details

### New Content Editors
1. Start with [Content Editor Setup](tutorials/content-editors/01-content-editor-setup.md)
2. Follow the tutorials in order (01-04)
3. Use how-to guides for specific content tasks
4. Refer to reference docs for formatting and requirements

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this training section follows these principles:

- **Beginner-friendly** - Assumes minimal prior knowledge
- **Practical** - Includes real examples from the codebase
- **Complete** - Provides all necessary information to accomplish tasks
- **Cross-referenced** - Links between related documents
- **Troubleshooting** - Includes common issues and solutions

## Contributing to Documentation

If you find errors, gaps, or areas for improvement in this documentation:

1. Check if there's an existing issue or discussion
2. Make improvements following the same structure and style
3. Keep documentation beginner-friendly and practical
4. Update cross-references when adding new content

## Getting Help

- For technical questions about the codebase, check the [Reference](reference/developers/) section
- For workflow questions, check the [Explanations](explanations/developers/) section
- For specific tasks, check the [How-to Guides](how-to-guides/developers/)
- If you're stuck, reach out to the maintainers
