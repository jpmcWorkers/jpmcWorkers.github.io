# JPMC Workers Alliance -- Quick Intro and Enlistment Guide

**Mission:** To improve working conditions, benefits, pay, and/or job security for all JPMC employees. The RTO mandate of 2025 brought us together, so hybrid work is our first goal.

**Current Leadership Structure:** Rag-Tag Band of Misfits.

**Core Beliefs:**

* The only way for us to get *and keep* concessions from management will be collective bargaining and ultimately a union contract.
* It will be a long grind to get there, but we can do it together -- with your help.
* The Company has a fiduciary duty to fight tooth-and-nail on every front: propaganda, intimidation, tirades, lies, threats -- in rare cases they may even commit violence (and may try to blame it on us).
* We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall persist in the offices, we shall inform the news media, we shall organize with growing confidence and growing strength in the break rooms and hallways.
  We shall continue our mission, whatever the cost may be. We shall discuss in the parking lots, we shall influence the job boards and the streets, we shall advocate on the internet; we shall never surrender!
  And even if this movement or a large part of it were forced out the door, then our colleagues in other companies and industries, supplemented by our numbers, would carry on the struggle, until,
  in good time, *the Worker* is on an equal footing with *Management* in setting fair standards for work and its compensation.

**Chat Groups:**

You'll need to [download Signal](https://signal.org/download/) to join the chat groups.
It is the most secure messaging solution available to the general public.
Versions exist for PC, Mac, Linux, Android, and iPhone/iPad.
It's recommended to [install on your phone](https://signal.org/install) first, and then sync to your desktop.

* [JWA Announcements](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA9LUxuzRjiImriCzuLFQ2gtLQ7F5Zzut_11RrYqlZYcEhBfREi9xBUBjAzFlS7gZ7ZM): Low-volume administrative posts and updates.
* [Coworker Chat](https://signal.group/#CjQKIDwqEmiOXpi1kQZJfa2N44RVa6NbyJtzuZ1Cgl4pSynoEhAP8fCsXOMG3deiLPJ-4G8m): Any sympathetic JPMC employee is welcome, from any level. High volume.
* [Organizing Group Chat](https://signal.group/#CjQKIPuBz1rZK3in9h_NKCWeHFswRV0f23ZebaZnh_6Exg6gEhAEeE8AMe2MY05FPjJzap8t): Union Business happens here. No Managers Allowed, per [National Labor Relations Act of 1935 as amended.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7/subchapter-II). Representatives from both UE and CWA/CBB are present.
* [Political Economy and Ideology](https://signal.group/#CjQKIIUyPrU0tXVxkHysbfoiAiOAkWJ6hDsOIn79TZn6XOWJEhDXmd7RBojwJKslZNMzeXzc): All talk of politics or economics goes here. May get snarky; stays respectful though.
* There is also a "dark-comedy" group which you can ask about. It tends to attract NSFW content, so we don't link it here directly.

**Abbreviations:**

* UE = United Electrical, one of the first unions we heard back from.
* CWA = Communication Workers of America, the same people the Wells Fargo unions affiliated with.
* CBB = Committee for Better Banks, the branch of CWA specifically focused on financial institutions.

We anticipate formally affiliating with one or both of them when the time is right.
(Why both? Different bargaining units...)

## Current Rules:

* Don't do anything illegal.
* Act with Respect.
* Balance consensus with initiative.

**Am I a manager?**

There's a [technical definition in the act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=29-USC-1697229976-858777245&term_occur=999&term_src=title:29:chapter:7:subchapter:II:section:152),
but as a general guide: If you have the authority to get someone (of your own choosing) hired, fired, disciplined, or similar -- you're a manager.
Merely participating in hiring interviews does not make you a manager. (It simply means your own manager trusts your judgement and discretion.)

## Tips:

* You MAY wish to change your signal name to appear anonymous.
* There MAY be spies.
	* It's unlawful if there are, but laws have been broken before.
	* See also: Settings >> Privacy >> Phone Number
* Stick around the chats and you'll soon get a sense of who's who.
* The chats do get chatty, so manage your phone notifications.

## Background:

We are not here to throw rocks. We are building an alliance of workers capable of standing up to one of the world's largest financial empires -- and winning.
Rome wasn't built in a day, and we will certainly all face RTO. It will hurt, but it will also:

* Shock us out of complacency
* Attract sympathizers
* Help us convince the undecided and the misinformed.

For now, we need to build a robust whisper-network and find a way to understand the scope of our reach.
We also need some volunteers to take on specific collateral duties related to organizing.
