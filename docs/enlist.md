# JPMC Workers Alliance -- Quick Intro and Enlistment Guide

**Mission:** To improve working conditions, benefits, pay, schedules, and/or job security for all JPMC employees. The RTO mandate of 2025 brought us together, so a return to hybrid work will always be a goal -- but there are others.

**Current Leadership Structure:** "Rag-Tag Band of Misfits" is evolving into the next stage.

## Watch This First!

* [Everything You Want to Know About Unions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd5x7vRZlT4) **Note: US-oriented, but still useful for UK.**

Afterwards, read through the resources as well.

## Core Beliefs:

* The best way for us to get *and keep* concessions from management will be collective bargaining and ultimately a union contract.
* It will be a long grind to get there, but we can do it together -- with your help.
* In the meanwhile, we are growing through a careful process. We need to be organized about that process.
* The Company has a fiduciary duty to fight tooth-and-nail on every front: propaganda, intimidation, tirades, lies, threats -- in rare cases they may even commit violence (and may try to blame it on us).
* We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall persist in the offices, we shall inform the news media, we shall organize with growing confidence and growing strength in the break rooms and hallways.
  We shall continue our mission, whatever the cost may be. We shall discuss in the parking lots, we shall influence the job boards and the streets, we shall advocate on the internet; we shall never surrender!
  And even if this movement or a large part of it were forced out the door, then our colleagues in other companies and industries, supplemented by our numbers, would carry on the struggle, until,
  in good time, *the Worker* is on an equal footing with *Management* in setting fair standards for work and its compensation.

## Chat Group:

You'll need to [have a Discord account](https://discord.com/) to join the JWA server.
It is a flexible, customizable, and robust platform in which we have established a secure vetting process.
Versions exist for PC, browser, Android, and iPhone/iPad. Request an invitation to the server by using the methods found on [our contact page](https://jpmcworkers.com/contact).

As we grow, concerns for trust and safety grow with us.
Therefore, to gain access to the main organizing group,
someone already in the group will have to invite you and tell an admin how they know you.

Discord is also the location of our weekly unionization voice/video calls, available to all non-managerial JPMC employees.

**Abbreviations:**

* UE = United Electrical, one of the first unions we heard back from.
* CWA = Communication Workers of America, the same people the Wells Fargo unions affiliated with.
* CBB = Committee for Better Banks, the branch of CWA specifically focused on financial institutions.

We anticipate formally affiliating with one of them when the time is right.


## Current Rules:

**Basics**

* Don't do anything illegal.
* Act with Respect.
* Balance consensus with initiative.
* Managers cannot join -- it's against the law. (There are some not-really-managers. [Check here.](/mgr))

**Copyrightable Media / Intellectual Property**

* We're working out how to handle this fairly at the moment.
* For now, nontrivial media contribution (Graphics, Sound, Video) is off limits while we decide on a policy.
* This will update soon.


## Tips:

* You MAY wish to change your signal name to appear anonymous.
* There MAY be spies.
	* It's unlawful if there are, but laws have been broken before.
	* See also: Settings >> Privacy >> Phone Number
* Stick around the chats and you'll soon get a sense of who's who.
* The chats do get chatty, so manage your phone notifications.

## Background:

We are not here to throw rocks. We are building an alliance of workers capable of standing up to one of the world's largest financial empires -- and winning.
Rome wasn't built in a day, and we will certainly all face RTO. It will hurt, but it will also:

* Shock us out of complacency
* Attract sympathizers
* Help us convince the undecided and the misinformed.

For now, we need to build a robust whisper-network and find a way to understand the scope of our reach.
We also need some volunteers to take on specific collateral duties related to organizing.
