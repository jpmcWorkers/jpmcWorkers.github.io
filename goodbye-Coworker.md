To our lovely friends who signed the petition:

Wow, it's been almost two months since the launch of our public petition on Coworker.org. 
In the interim, many JPMC corporate sites have already imposed the 5-day in-office mandate. More will be starting in a few more weeks or months. Other large corporations have also jumped on the RTO bandwagon. Our clear refutation of their alleged reasons only goes to show that it was all disingeuous theater; It's no surprise that Jamie Dimon blatantly disregards the nearly 2000 signatures on this petition. 

However, our efforts have not been in vain.

The process to publish and promote this petition practiced us in the arts of networking, organizing, and collective action. Now we pivot to expand our budding collective into the beginnings of unionization, and grow its influence as we step boldly forth into the modern Labor Movement -- a global response to ever more concentrated weath amid a stagnant, repressive job market. Employees of Wells Fargo, Starbucks, and Amazon have achieved union recognition.
So can we!

Unionizing is neither fast nor easy, but it is absolutely worthwhile. We will all surely RTO, whether with JPMC or any of the other near-peers that have adopted similar mandates. But joining together in solidarity grows our leverage to prevent similar attacks on our quality-of-life in the future, and to make our workplace better for all employees. In the interim, it offers much-needed hope, community, comradery, and shared resources. We are currently adding members, tapping into new portions of the JPMC workforce, converging on shared experiences and roles/job functions, and growing strong bonds of trust among like-minded workers.
