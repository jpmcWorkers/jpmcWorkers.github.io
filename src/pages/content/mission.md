# Our Real Goals:

## Work-Life-Balance in Employee Control!

* Stop evaluating people on in-office attendance.

	Empower each team to decide its own in-office scheduling needs and remote-work flexibility
	without interference from higher management.

* Evaluate individuals *and teams* only on:

	1. Business Results
	2. Client/Customer Focus
	3. Teamwork/Leadership
	4. Risk and Controls

	Hold teams accountable for business outcomes,
	not for the number of minutes spent at the office.


This does *not* mean working any less, or slacking off.
It means working in the times, places, and methods that most effectively achieve business objectives.
We deserve the freedom to choose when and for how long we're in-office.
We also deserve a culture of mutual trust.

(Obviously trust can be lost. Teams can deal with that, if you trust managers. You should trust managers. You made them managers, after all!)

## Repair the Culture.

* Rebuild Labor's trust in Management

	Upper management has broken important promises.
	Nothing can fix that but contractual provisions.
	That's why we will soon aim to compose a union.

* Empower Labor (and Line Management) to make decisions

	Line management has often been a mouthpiece and shield
	for carrying out the edict-of-the-month from upper
	management. Instead, delegate the power to make decisions,
	which means also sharing real business goals and data,
	rather than tactical "make-X-happen" dictates.
	
	You'd be surprised what creative solutions people can
	come up with -- when you let them.

## Share the Wealth

* Make JPMC the best employer for the best employees

The firm has reported record profits for several years in a row,
but wages for most employees have stagnated: They barely keep
up with inflation.

Average yearly raises among non-management should proportionally
reflect the profits earned by the company as a whole. For example,
if profits are up 10%, then the average raise should be 10%.


## Genuine legal protection for what gains we make

As things stand in January of 2025, the employer can
just *alter the deal* whenever they like.
Rather than *pray they don't alter it any further,*
we mean to exercise our right to organize and bargain
collectively in a democratic process.
