JPMC Workers Alliance Discord Server (30 January 2026) --

## Preamble:

On 7 January 2026, agents of the United States Federal Government acting under the banner
of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, shot and killed
US citizen Renee Good in her car after she had done nothing worse than criticize the
agency's presence and actions in her city.

Seventeen days later, on 24 January 2026, agents under the same banner murdered US citizen
Alex Pretti in cold blood by holding him down and shooting him ten times in the back,
after he had done nothing more heinous than film some of their actions with his cell-phone camera.

Both of these outrages were captured on amateur video from many angles and shared widely, eliminating all doubt
as to the true course of events. If you have the stomach to watch, there is only one conclusion:
US citizens are being killed for exercising their civil rights.

This is not the America that any of us grew up in, and it is not the America that we should
hand down to posterity. As citizens of these fifty states we call home, and even as humans
worthy of the title, the members of the JPMC Workers Alliance can no longer stand silent.
We must stand together, speak out, and take actions as necessary to end this reign of terror
that an out-of-control and unjustly-militarized federal agency is visiting upon our cities.

## We Condemn ICE Actions in Minneapolis and Across the Land.

We strongly condemn the violence, terror, and instability caused by ICE enforcement
actions that have led to deaths, family separation, and deep trauma in our communities.
As workers, we do not leave our compassion at the door when we come in.
We are community members first -— neighbors, parents, siblings, friends -— many of us living in
neighborhoods directly impacted by immigration raids and enforcement.
Many of us have immigrant loved ones who we cherish deeply.
The grief, fear, and uncertainty molded by this violence is lived everyday.

The fear does not stop at the workplace. It follows workers into our jobs in the form of stress,
trauma, and safety concerns. Workers are expected to perform under impossible conditions while
worrying about their loved ones, navigating disrupted communities, and supporting clients and
colleagues who are also affected. This is not a political issue; this is an issue of human dignity.

We reject attempts to divide workers by immigration status, job title, or background. Today,
immigrant workers and families are being targeted, and tomorrow, it could be somebody else.
History has shown us that when harm is normalized against one group, it spreads to another.
Where terror plagues, humanity cures. Solidarity is the way we protect one another, no matter the stakes.

As a union, we stand for dignity, safety, and justice for all people. We oppose systems that
rely on fear, violence, and dehumanizing our peers. We strongly affirm our commitment to supporting
all people affected by immigration enforcement -- through solidarity, advocacy, mutual aid, and
collective action. We will continue to speak out, organize, and demand a world where individuals
are safe in their homes, communities, and jobs.

Our greatest strength as a society is each other. We will not be silent, and we will not stand by
while our communities are harmed.

## Call to Action for Workers Everywhere in the United States:

All government operates by the consent of the governed. We must show our elected representatives
(peacefully!) that *we do not consent* to a government acting as it has in January in Minneapolis.
To that end, the JPMC Workers Alliance urges each and every citizen to visit, call, or write the
office of their Senators and Congressmen and give their staff a piece of your mind.

Follow <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member" target="blank">this link</a>
to find contact information for your elected representatives. Tell them:

* How you feel about ICE's actions, and what you want done about it.
* To carry out their Constitutional duty to check the power of an executive branch run amok.
* That it's not just your own vote riding on this, but that of every red-blooded American.

*Make sure to hit that "red-blooded American" phrase, especially with older representatives.*
*It will really resonate with the cold-war vibes they grew up with.*

**Protests rallies can also help send a message, especially with journalistic connections. Stay safe out there!**

## Update: Senate Blocks ICE Funding! (For Now.)

https://newrepublic.com/post/205890/eight-republicans-senate-democrats-block-dhs-funding-bill

TLDR: Thursday, 29 January, eight Republican senators joined every Democrat to block a budget
that would have funded ICE. This risks government shut-down, but shows Republicans stepping up.
Democrats want to halt all funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, the parent-agency
of ICE) while negotiating with the Republican party to legislate reasonable boundaries to
tactics the government may use to enforce immigration laws.
