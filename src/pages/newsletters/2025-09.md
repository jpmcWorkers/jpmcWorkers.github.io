<h4></h4><h4>What would make you feel appreciated?</h4>
<p>Later this month, JPMC will celebrate Employee Appreciation Week.</p><p>In preparation, we want to know what would really make <strong><em>you</em></strong> feel appreciated as an employee.</p><p>A
 raise? A reduction in unpaid overtime? More flexibility? More pizza 
and/or cake parties sponsored by Chase? More Chase swag? A share in 
profits?</p><p>Whatever it is, <strong>w</strong><strong>e want to hear from you</strong>. Please take a few minutes to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRlWrpQ23i24sN0i5UTZgQ_A9ORsc0yeUtpPUxFVTbCFDB2g/viewform">fill out this brief survey</a> and let us know!</p><p><br></p><h2>From Around The Net:</h2><p>Layoffs hurt. Stress, uncertainty, and “do more with less” hurts. It’s easy to look at our growing union movement and think “they” should fix it.</p><p><em><strong>
But a union isn’t “they.” It’s us.</strong></em></p><p>We are currently at the beginning of our journey towards unionization, with small but steady support. This means that we have a community providing mutual aid and credible information, as well as documenting harms and patterns.</p><p>We've focused on coworker funded events at the McCoy Center with the specific purpose of growing our numbers. As we grow and expand our support, we will be able to start taking targeted actions that win specific fixes and build public backing.</p><p>Not just that, but the more our numbers expand, the stronger we are and the more we are protected from retaliatory action, not just legally, but in reality.</p><p><strong>Five </strong><strong>hund</strong><strong>red</strong> people scattered throughout the McCoy Center taking place in a walkout or other demonstration might not even be noticed. <strong>Five </strong><strong>thousand </strong>people would not only be noticed but would almost definitely cause a change in policy.</p><p>Our power is not what a few strong people are willing to do. We will not win a hybrid schedule by a handful of people going to management and asking, no matter how they ask.</p><p><strong>Our power is our numbers.</strong></p><p>With majority support, even just in one bargaining unit, we get formal recognition and a bargaining table for enforceable layoff processes, severance standards, transfer options, and just-cause protections.</p><p><br></p><p><span></span></p><h3>If you want to see real change and improve our quality of life, help grow our numbers.</h3><p>Simply letting us know you exist and support us is helpful, whether by emailing jpmcworkers@gmail.com or <a href="https://discord.gg/BZA3pxppq9">joining our discord server</a>.</p><p>The smallest level of participation is letting the officers know who you are, so we can see how many people are ready to form your bargaining unit.</p><p>The biggest help is recruiting your coworkers!</p><p>The best way to do that is by having 1:1 conversations where you listen to their concerns and share your own, building mutual trust and understanding.</p><p>If you aren't comfortable doing that, there are tons of options in between:</p><ul><li>Attend union meetings and join conversations in Discord</li><li>Share your ideas for things the union could do</li><li>Prepare materials for people to hang up or hand out</li><li>Create something for this newsletter or for us to post to social media</li><li>Design a poster, booklet, or other material</li><li>Volunteer to help with an event</li></ul><p>Power = people × participation.</p><p> If we want bigger, faster wins, we have to grow our list, our conversations, and our active participation.</p><p>
This Labor Day, join us and help turn “they” into “we.”</p><p><br></p><h4>Just for fun</h4><figure>The company told us to make greater use of AI. Our very own CorpOracle did just that:<br><img src="https://can2-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/data/001/036/866/original/blob" alt="" title="" style="width: 100%; max-width: 50%;" align="" width="50%"><br></figure><br><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;">REMEMBER</span></p>
<p>The union is us. We are the union.
