<h4></h4><p>Another quarter has flown past!</p><p><br></p><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ol><li>Q3 Earnings Report</li><li>The Unioniad: A Ballad of the Workers Three</li><li>Elections are coming!</li></ol><p><br></p><h3>Did you see the Q3 earnings report?</h3><p>The bank is on track to make about the same amount of money as last year (despite RTO and some number of confounding factors), with an average profit margin so far of 31% of revenues.</p><p>In January, when next you hear there's no money in the budget for raises or bonuses, I want you to remember that you just personally gave $200,000 to the shareholders this past year. Each and every one of us. More, if the layoffs were more than a matter of stirring the pot.</p><p>Not only that, but as you may recall from July, we like to do some math on quarterly revenue.</p><p>For Q3 2025, our net income was $14.4 billion. A quarter (25%) of that is $3.6 billion.</p><p>If all 300,000 of us received an equal share of that amount, we would each be getting a check for $12,000.<br></p><p>If we add in Q1 and Q2, that figure has become $36,500 so far this year. Even if profits dip a little in Q4, that number for all 2025 will likely be <strong>$48,000</strong>.<br></p><p>Even if half of that went to taxes and withdrawals, it's enough to pay a $2,000 mortgage for an entire year, or put a 20% down payment on a small house ($120k is not much of a house in most cities, but still). </p><p>Again, WE earned that money, you and I. It is our efforts that keep this company running and bringing in revenue.</p><p>Some of us don't even make $48k in wages, but we've all earned that amount in profits.</p><p>Even if you're a software developer, getting paid well compared to the average American, you're still creating 5-10x more value than your salary if you do your job.</p><p>How high would your quality of life become if you were actually paid fairly, and given a fair share of profits?</p><p>How much debt would you pay off?</p><p>How many friends and family members would you help?</p><p>THIS is why even relatively high earners need a union.</p><p>As always, we invite you to <a href="https://discord.gg/BZA3pxppq9">hop on our Discord server</a> to get involved.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Unioniad: A Ballad of the Workers Three</h3><div>(An epic tale in the style of Homer, retelling the JWA meetings of September 2025. Created by BK with the help of LLM tools.)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Book I – The Rise of the Red Tags</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Sing, Muse, of Discord’s fire and fight,</div><div>Where workers gathered on digital night.</div><div>Momma Beth, the Oracle, raised her voice,</div><div>And summoned the crew to make their choice.</div><div><br></div><div>Nine brave souls in the virtual ring,</div><div>Chose Sunday for meetings&mdash;a weekend king.</div><div>From coasts both East and mighty West,</div><div>They voted for rest, but also progress.</div><div><br></div><div>The numbers grew, a swelling tide:</div><div>Two hundred vetted, more joined the ride.</div><div>Mentors arose with guiding flame,</div><div>To lead the greenhorns through the game.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Book II – The Deeds of Daniel</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Hark! Daniel, bold, in public did proclaim</div><div>His fealty to the union’s name.</div><div>At Town Hall’s court, with courage stout,</div><div>He cast aside all fear and doubt.</div><div><br></div><div>“Lo, layoffs come,” he told the throng,</div><div>“But organized, we all grow strong.”</div><div>He shared the Discord, shared the dream,</div><div>And sparked a fire, a righteous gleam.</div><div><br></div><div>The people stirred, the winds did change,</div><div>JPMC felt a tremor strange.</div><div>For justice born of Epstein’s sin,</div><div>Might bring the workers’ triumph in.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Book III – The Lawful Flame</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Then rose wise Beth with scroll in hand,</div><div>And spoke of statutes across the land.</div><div>"By Section Seven’s sacred might,</div><div>The worker holds collective right."</div><div><br></div><div>She told of ballots, held with pride,</div><div>And Weingarten’s shield at every side.</div><div>Of micro-unions, sharp and small,</div><div>That make the giant’s towers fall.</div><div><br></div><div>“Beware,” she warned, “the yellow snare&mdash;</div><div>The faux support, the vacant care.</div><div>Let not the managers deceive,</div><div>Or promises make you naive.”</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Book IV – The Trials of Nani</strong></div><div><br></div><div>But lo! a tale of hardship came&mdash;</div><div>From Nani’s lips, a tale of shame.</div><div>Hired remote in COVID’s wake,</div><div>Now forced a Jersey path to take.</div><div><br></div><div>New York’s office she could not claim,</div><div>Though closer lived, denied by name.</div><div>The costs arose, the soul did fray,</div><div>Commuting stole her joy each day.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet from her strife a plan was born&mdash;</div><div>To rally peers with voices torn.</div><div>Together strong, they would demand</div><div>A seat&mdash;not distant, but close at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Book V – The Shadow of the Tower</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Then Cassie spoke of IRS scrolls,</div><div>And GitHub’s gate with cautious roles.</div><div>The nonprofit wheel began to turn,</div><div>As torches for donations burn.</div><div><br></div><div>Dimon, the great, with furrowed brow,</div><div>Was questioned at the EAW.</div><div>He praised "together," then recoiled&mdash;</div><div>At unity not shareholder-oiled.</div><div><br></div><div>From Teams to flyers, whispers spread,</div><div>As quiet plans were boldly said.</div><div>"Let them measure our every breath&mdash;</div><div>But numbers won't outlast our depth."</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Final Chorus – The Call to All</strong></div><div><br></div><div>So gather ye workers, from floor to floor,</div><div>The tides of change beat at the door.</div><div>The union lives in every name&mdash;</div><div>Each red tag, lunch chat, kindled flame.</div><div><br></div><div>Sing, Muse, of boldness in the face of might,</div><div>For even giants sleep at night.</div><div>And when they wake to workers' song,</div><div>They’ll find their grip is not so strong.</div><p><br></p><h3>Elections are coming!</h3><p>As November fast approaches, those of us in the USA will have local elections.</p><p>With national news being easier to access than local news, it is easy to ignore these off-year elections.</p><p>However, it is at the local level that it is easiest to get involved and make something happen.</p><p>Those who vote get heard. Those who don't give up their agency.</p><p>Don't wait for some vague "them" to make your life better. Get involved and be the change you want to see in the world.</p><br><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;">REMEMBER</span></p>
