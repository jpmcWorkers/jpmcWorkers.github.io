- Myth — short statement
- Fact — short, evidence-based reply you can share aloud

## Myth: The union is a third party that will come between us
**Fact:** You and your coworkers are the union. It’s a democratic organization of employees that negotiates enforceable rules with management — not a third-party that replaces your voice.
**Why it matters:** A union empowers collective decision-making and enforcement of workplace rules, which protects everyone from arbitrary actions.

---

## Myth: Management isn’t anti-union — a union just isn’t right here
**Fact:** When campaigns start, employers commonly use captive meetings and consultants to dissuade workers. Neutral employers don’t spend resources on anti-union campaigns.

---

## Myth: Unions are outdated in today’s economy
**Fact:** Unions are actively organizing in modern sectors (tech, logistics, retail, higher education) because they address current problems like surveillance, remote work rights, and pay equity.

---

## Myth: Bargaining starts from zero — you could lose what you have
**Fact:** First contracts typically start from current wages and benefits. Any contract must be ratified by workers before it takes effect. Retaliatory cuts are illegal.

---

## Myth: Unions just want your dues
**Fact:** Dues are set democratically by members and fund bargaining, legal support, safety, and strike benefits. Many workers see net financial gains from union representation.

---

## Myth: Union leaders are outsiders or corrupt, and they’ll force strikes
**Fact:** Unions are member‑run with elections and financial reporting. Strikes require a democratic vote and are uncommon; employers more often stall bargaining than unions force conflict.

---

## Myth: If you unionize, the company will close or move
**Fact:** Threatening to close or move in order to stop union activity can be illegal. Many unionization-related closures have prompted NLRB cases; profitable, unionized companies are common.

---

## Myth: Union organizers are lying; look at these bad actors
**Fact:** Employers often point to isolated scandals while ignoring systemic unlawful conduct like firings, threats, and captive meetings. Federal oversight and reporting requirements apply to unions.

---

## Myth: If a union comes in, you’ll be forced to go on strike
**Fact:** No one can be forced to strike. Strikes are decided by members and are used as a last resort. Having the option to strike improves bargaining leverage.

---

## Myth: If we unionize, everyone will be forced to join and pay dues
**Fact:** Closed shops were outlawed in 1947. In most places membership is voluntary; in some states ("right-to-work") you may not even be required to pay fees.

---

## Myth: Unions protect lazy workers and hold back high performers
**Fact:** Unions promote fair, transparent processes for discipline (such as "just cause"). Poor performers can still be addressed under those rules; unions reduce favoritism and reward experience.

---

## Myth: Unions cause conflict and a hostile work environment
**Fact:** A union creates structured, peaceful ways to resolve disputes. Most hostility around organizing comes from employer anti‑union tactics, not union activity.
