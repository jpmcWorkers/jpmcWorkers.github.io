Happy May, JWA!

May 1st was MayDay, also known as International Workers' Day!

Whether you've just joined us, or have been on board for a while, either way- welcome! MayDay marked a big accomplishment for the JPMC Workers Alliance.
We coordinated and executed our first public in-person event- a pizza party in the 2J wing of the 1111 Polaris office, the McCoy Center. 
This location was selected due to a high concentration of software engineers, who represent a large portion of our active JWA members. 
Through this action, we hope to get to know more of our fellow SWEs, especially those who could help us to form our firm's first bargaining unit.
We [advertised](https://jpmcworkers.com/img/posters/Pizza%20party.png) ahead of time to garner interest and awareness of the upcoming event.
We purchased and served 45 large pizzas, accompanied by approximately 300 tri-fold pamphlets (See [front](https://jpmcworkers.com/img/posters/Trifold%20side%201.png) and [back](https://jpmcworkers.com/img/posters/Trifold%20side%202.png)) to our hungry colleagues.
And most importantly, we had active, engaging, and agitating conversations with our peers, finding common ground and the beginnings of support.

What's next?

If you are interested in getting involved in the planning of more events and outreach like this,
or simply wish to provide feedback, or air your Employee Opinion to an audience who will actually care what you have to say,
please respond to this email, and we will be with you as soon as we can. Or join [our community](https://discord.gg/BZA3pxppq9) directly!

In addition to the pizza party activity, we are still collecting testimonies of those who are [struggling with the ADA/Reasonable Accommodations process](https://jpmcworkers.com/img/posters/Reasonable_Accommodations0.5x.png), with several interested parties to speak to.

Change is coming. Be a part of it.

Excitedly,
The JWA
