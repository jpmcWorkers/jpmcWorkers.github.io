# Pre-Majority Union / Minority Union

* Video Link: [What is Pre-Majority Unionism?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8STqCY-7kkw)

A **Minority Union** is an established entity that acts as, and claims the title of, union, before having the size and support to win an NLRB election.
This has been a successful model in large established employers.
The model lacks full union power, but has made significant inroads in establishing a union presence in a hostile employer.


* Establishes a union presence.
* Takes our brand to the next level.
* Creates mind-share.
* Facilitates growth toward super-majority.
* Does not need to worry about bargaining units.

JPMC won’t recognize this immediately; that comes with time.

## Activities

Keep everything on the down-low until the dam breaks.

* **Educate People on Their Rights.** e.g. OSHA, ADA accommodations, NLRB, etc.
* **Hold Company to Account** e.g. in media and with enforcement agencies.
* **Mutual Aid Society** e.g. help organize rideshare, events, how to adult, maybe professional development, and so forth.
* Train some stewards.  <-- Do not use this word where management can hear it. They'll crank up the union-busting temperature.
* People sign union cards.  <-- Requires trust.
* Potential voluntary dues.  <-- Requires us to set up accounting and register for 501(c)(5) status as a labor organization.

## Powers

* Establishes a stable, long-term entity that shifts the balance of power.
* The company needs to account for the union’s actions.
* Lacks the force of law to drag the company to the bargaining table.
  (Then again, companies play dirty. e.g. Amazon warehouse union won legal recognition;
  Amazon decided to break the law and ignore it. Battle is ongoing.)

## The Point

* We decide if we are a union. Not NLRB; not JPMC; etc.
* In this status, we do not need to worry about bargaining units.
* Our coercive power comes from (the prospect of) collective action, and not from law.
