<h1>Happy August!</h1>
<p>
  We did it! We hosted another successful event, the Summer Splash at Polaris!
</p>
<p>We served approximately 450 ice cream sandwiches and 5 whole watermelons!</p>
<p>
  A conservative estimate for the number of attendees is 400, at least 100 more
  than attended the pizza party a few months ago. Although this may feel like a
  small increase, there are two factors worth considering.
</p>
<p>
  First, this event was clearly advertised as a union event. We even heard a
  couple of people say that their manager had told the team they couldn’t
  attend. That is a violation of the National Labor Relations Act (section
  8(a)(1)), but how many of us employees are aware of that?
</p>
<p>
  Second, this event was held outside, on the opposite side of the building from
  where most people sit. The pizza party was directly next to many people’s
  desks, and even those who had not seen signs saw the piles of pizza pass by,
  tempting them to follow.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that we saw more people show up despite these two factors is a huge
  win!
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we know there is always room to improve, and we have learned some
  valuable lessons.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
<p>
  Our biggest lesson was simply around time and numbers. A handful of us did all
  of the work for this event in two weeks.
</p>
<p>
  While that clearly works to some extent, it leads to some of us pushing
  ourselves too hard and then having to take some time away from organizing to
  rest.
</p>
<p>
  We cannot treat unionizing a company this huge as a sprint, or even a series
  of sprints. It is a marathon, or perhaps more accurately, a very long relay
  race.
</p>
<p>
  Truthfully, the event would have been a bigger success if more people were
  involved in planning and preparation.
</p>
<p>
  Particularly, there were not enough people hanging posters and folding
  booklets.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, having plenty of people hanging posters does very little when they
  are actively being removed.
</p>
<p>
  To help with this, we have talked about a staggered lunch, where the first
  shift hangs posters and following shifts keep an eye out until those posters
  are removed. If the removal of posters can be recorded and shown to be a
  violation of the NLRA, we can open an unfair labor practice violation.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve also learned that frozen handouts are difficult. Until we have the
  resources to do them properly, we will stick to handouts that are less
  temperature sensitive.
</p>
<p>
  Further, at our next event, we will have some clicker counters. This allows
  for a comfortably anonymous number of attendees, so we can report our
  successes more accurately.
</p>
<p>From our very own Nic Welch:</p>
<blockquote>
  Be mindful of your own energy... you're no good to us dead! This is a MASSIVE
  task, if it was easy everyone would be doing it. Be able to talk about the
  benefits of unionization, be able to confirm that it is LEGAL and PROTECTED
  and that you have the absolute right to discuss working conditions with your
  coworkers and to advocate for yourself. Talk about bargaining units, share
  ideas on how to establish such a thing. Participate as much or as little as
  you like... but DO SOMETHING!
</blockquote>
<p>
  Note: One of those working conditions we’re allowed to discuss is salary. No
  matter how “rude” your managers may call it, that discussion adds transparency
  and a point of reference. This lets people get a better idea of whether there
  are discriminatory practices happening in the setting of salaries.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Union Dues</h4>
<p>The two most important pieces of information are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dues only start <strong>after </strong>we vote to ratify our union
      contract.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When we vote on our union contract, we will vote for pay improvements more
      than sufficient to cover the dues.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To reiterate, union dues are NOT applicable until we agree on a contract, and
  we will include a raise. This means union dues are part of a pay increase, and
  <em>will not reduce the amount you currently bring home to your family</em>.
</p>
<p>
  We are working with the Communication Workers of America, so the dues rate
  will be 1.5%. Most likely, we will vote for at least a 10% raise, although the
  exact amount is up to us.
</p>
<p><strong>But why would you want to pay union dues?</strong></p>
<p>
  Besides all of the day-to-day benefits that come with a union, such as higher
  pay and a return to flexibility, another reason to pay union dues is for
  financial security.
</p>
<p>
  Should the company force a strike, accumulated union dues are used to keep
  striking workers fed and housed.
</p>
<p>
  If a union member is unjustly fired, union dues are used to help that worker
  stay afloat through any legal proceedings.
</p>
<p>
  Again, we do not have union dues yet, and will not have them until we have a
  contract fully negotiated, agreed upon, ratified, and enacted.
</p>
<p>
  Contract negotiations will not even <em>begin</em> until after the first
  bargaining unit has won its election to officially unionize. And an election
  doesn't happen until we gather enough support to trigger it (this is what we
  mean by “critical mass”).
</p>
<p>
  As you can imagine, we are still a very long way away from collecting
  mandatory union dues from anybody’s paycheck!
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Financial Contributions</h4>
<p>
  Until then, any and all financial contributions to our efforts are strictly
  voluntary.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, if your budget is tight, I personally encourage you not to donate
  until you can do so without jeopardizing your own finances. If your budget has
  some leeway, however, please consider allocating some of it to our cause, to
  help fund more fun and engaging events like the Summer Splash, and to cover
  operational costs like printing and legal fees.
</p>
<p>
  We said in the special edition newsletter two weeks ago that we would have a
  contribution link ready. Unfortunately, we have hit another legal snag.
</p>
<p>
  While we are incorporated with the state of Ohio, we do not yet have an IRS
  tax status. Specifically, we are registering with the IRS as a 501(c)(5) labor
  organization.
</p>
<p>
  Once that registration is complete, we will be able to send out a contribution
  link to all of you lovely people.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>
  Regardless of legal status, we are an organization
  <em>of, by, and for</em> the workers of JPMC.
</p>
<p>
  Our primary mission is to improve working conditions for all JPMC workers --
  eventually through a legal mandate for collective bargaining, but first
  through advocacy and every other legitimate means at our disposal.
</p>
<p>The foundation for this mission has four layers.</p>
<p>
  First, awareness. The workers must know that we exist, we are real, and we are
  not giving up until we have won.
</p>
<p>
  Second, education. We distribute literature that informs employees of our
  rights and how to exercise them, in order to help us improve our working
  conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Third, participation. We're blessed with a few people willing to do a lot, but
  we also need a lot of people willing to do a little. To that end,<a
    href="https://jpmcworkers.com/things-to-do"
  >
    here's a list</a
  >
  of little ways to help the cause.
</p>
<p>
  Fourth, resources. Unionizing is fulfilling work, but producing educational
  materials and throwing events can’t be done for free. That’s why we’re setting
  up a better way for everyone to financially contribute to the cause.
</p>
<p>Here’s a little table of approximate expenses thus far:</p>
<div></div>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><strong>Donations Collected</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Amount Spent</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Pizza Party</strong></td>
      <td>$500</td>
      <td>$500</td>

      <td><strong>Ice Cream Social</strong></td>
      <td>$450</td>
      <td>$430</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Materials Production</strong></td>
      <td>$160</td>
      <td>$920</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<div></div>
<p>
  Around 5000 sheets of letter paper - a full case! - have gone towards printing
  for the union effort. This includes 300 tri-fold flyers for the pizza party,
  hundreds of posters, ~1200 button pins and magnets, and over 3,000 booklets.
</p>
<p>
  Many of those posters, pins, and booklets are still in need of distribution!
  If you wish to help, please reply to this email or ping Reggie through
  Discord.

<h4>Booklet Collection</h4>
<p>
  Speaking of our booklet collection, we now have 6 different designs!

</p>
<p>
  We are always on the lookout for new booklets to add to the collection, so
  please share any ideas you have!
</p>
<p>
  Currently, we would like to design a booklet specifically tailored towards
  branch-based employees, because branches are easily defined bargaining units.
  Our sister effort at Wells Fargo has successfully unionized 28 branches!
</p>
<p>
  If you are or know somebody who is a Chase branch employee, please send us
  suggestions for common branch issues, grievances, imagery, and language that
  might appeal to the workers in our most public-facing roles.
</p>

<h4>tell people about us</h4>

  Finally, if you’d like to help make change happen, talk with your colleagues
  in private to help grow our movement toward critical mass.<br />
