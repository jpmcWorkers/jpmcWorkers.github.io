To our lovely friends who signed up for our mailing list:

Whether you found our mailing list as a continuation of the Coworker.org petition, via jpmcworkers.com, or even from one of the flyers we've printed out, welcome! We're in this effort for the long haul, and we're hoping that you are, too.

To recap the effort so far: 
* On January 20th 2025, JPMC corporate announced internally that flexible and remote work would be ending. Employees started speaking out via internal channels of communication, which led to like-minded discussion via external channels of communication.
* On February 10th, we published [our petition](/openletter). By the time Jamie Dimon [disregarded it verbally](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-derides-in-office-work-pushback-demands-efficiency-2025-02-13/) during his town hall on February 12th, it already had hundreds of signatures.
* On March 3rd, many JPMC corporate sites started the 5-day return to office. Many more sites will be starting on April 21st, and several other corporations continue to follow the RTO trend. 

The reasons given for full-time RTO are disingeuous and clearly refutable. By now, there are nearly 2000 signatures on the original petition, and corporate disregard of employee voices only serves to prove that they do not have our best interests at heart.
However, our efforts have not been in vain.

Through the process of publishing and promoting our petition, we have become more practiced at networking and organizing collective actions. This allows us to transition towards the direction of unionization - 
as part of the modern Labor movement, another global trend which has arisen in response to the current state of the economy and job market. If employees of Wells Fargo, Starbucks and Amazon can do it, so can we.

The process of unionization is not a fast or easy one, but it is worthwhile. It cannot happen quickly enough to prevent us from having to choose between working in-office five days a week or working for a different company. But it can gradually give us leverage to prevent quality-of-life attacks like this in the future, and to make our workplace better for all employees. And in the meantime, it can give us much-needed hope, community, comradery, shared resources, and a sense of purpose. We are currently growing our numbers, sorting into shares job functions, recruiting into un-tapped portions of the JPMC workforce, working with already-established unions, collecting instances of unfair labor practices and ADA violations (especially those related to the denial of WFH as an accommodation), and overall, growing at the speed of trust.
